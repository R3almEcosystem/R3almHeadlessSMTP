# Feature Specifications

> R3almHeadlessSMTP · Platform · Pre-Alpha

R3almHeadlessSMTP is cataloged as a Platform application focused on email and messaging operations.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Core capability: manage a message

**Users:** authors, messaging operators, recipients, and administrators.  
**Goal:** deliver controlled, observable messaging workflows.  
**Lifecycle:** compose or ingest → validate → deliver → observe.

### Functional requirements

1. Accept only authorized, schema-valid input.
2. Show the authoritative state and the next permitted action.
3. Enforce domain transitions and required approvals server-side.
4. Make retries safe and prevent duplicate side effects.
5. Preserve the source and reason for material outcomes.
6. Provide actionable errors and a recovery route.
7. Produce redacted operational and audit evidence.

### Acceptance criteria

- An authorized user completes the happy path.
- Invalid, duplicate, expired, and unauthorized requests fail safely.
- Partial dependency failure never appears as completed success.
- Refresh or retry preserves consistent state.
- Keyboard and assistive-technology use is verified for user-facing flows.
- Operators can correlate a reported problem without reading sensitive content.
- Deletion, retention, and export behavior match approved governance.

## Additional features

Create one section per verified repository capability with users, problem, non-goals, states, rules, permissions, data, integrations, accessibility, telemetry, risks, and acceptance tests. Do not infer shipped functionality from names alone.
