# Engineering Setup

> R3almHeadlessSMTP · Platform · Pre-Alpha

R3almHeadlessSMTP is cataloged as a Platform application focused on email and messaging operations.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Prerequisites

Use the Node.js version and package manager selected by the lockfile. Inspect `package.json` scripts before running install, build, test, or development commands.

Also obtain only the development-scoped access needed for this repository. Never copy production credentials or datasets into a local environment.

## Safe bootstrap

1. Clone `R3almEcosystem/R3almHeadlessSMTP` and check out its default branch.
2. Read the root README, manifests, lockfiles, example environment files, and contribution guidance.
3. Install the exact toolchain version declared by the project.
4. Create a local environment file from the committed example; use development values.
5. Install dependencies with the lockfile-preserving command.
6. Run the repository's validation, test, build, and development scripts.
7. Confirm the primary email and messaging operations flow against local or isolated services.

## Environment variables

Document each variable in a committed example file with purpose, required/optional state, safe local value, and server/client exposure. Secret values belong in an approved secret manager, not Git, logs, screenshots, fixtures, or browser bundles.

## Definition of ready

A workstation is ready when installation is reproducible, required checks pass, the application starts without production access, and the developer can explain how to reset local state. If the repository lacks exact commands, add them to the root README before relying on this baseline.
