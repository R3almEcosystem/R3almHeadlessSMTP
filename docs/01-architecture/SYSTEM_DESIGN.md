# System Design

> R3almHeadlessSMTP · Platform · Pre-Alpha

R3almHeadlessSMTP is cataloged as a Platform application focused on email and messaging operations.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Primary transaction

A message moves through **compose or ingest → validate → deliver → observe**. Each transition must define its actor, prerequisites, validation, durable state change, emitted evidence, retry behavior, and user-visible result.

## Component responsibilities

| Component | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Interface | Collect explicit intent and display authoritative state |
| Application service | Authorize and coordinate one business operation |
| Domain rules | Reject invalid transitions and preserve invariants |
| Repository/adapter | Persist or retrieve through a narrow interface |
| Integration client | Apply timeout, retry, idempotency, and schema validation |
| Telemetry | Emit correlation-safe metrics, logs, traces, and audit events |

## Reliability model

- Assign a correlation ID at the entry boundary.
- Use idempotency keys for retryable writes and external side effects.
- Bound retries with backoff; route exhausted work to an operator-visible state.
- Never report success before the durable source of truth acknowledges the change.
- Prefer explicit states over ambiguous booleans.
- Define recovery for partial completion before enabling the workflow in production.

## Performance and scale

Establish service-level indicators from observed traffic rather than invented forecasts. Measure request latency, workflow completion time, queue age where applicable, error rate, saturation, and dependency health. Load tests must use anonymized or synthetic data.

## Open design decisions

Record the authoritative runtime topology, persistence engine, authentication mechanism, integration inventory, availability objective, recovery objectives, and capacity assumptions as ADRs once verified.
