# Vision

> R3almHeadlessSMTP · Platform · Pre-Alpha

R3almHeadlessSMTP is cataloged as a Platform application focused on email and messaging operations.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Purpose

R3almHeadlessSMTP exists to deliver controlled, observable messaging workflows. It should help authors, messaging operators, recipients, and administrators complete the compose or ingest → validate → deliver → observe lifecycle with clear state, understandable outcomes, and recoverable failures.

## Principles

1. **Evidence over assumption.** Product and operational claims link to implementation or measured evidence.
2. **Users retain agency.** High-impact actions are understandable, confirmable, and reversible when the domain permits.
3. **Secure by default.** Least privilege, data minimization, and safe failure behavior apply from the first release.
4. **Observable operations.** Important actions produce useful telemetry without leaking sensitive payloads.
5. **Interoperable boundaries.** Integrations use versioned contracts and idempotent behavior where practical.

## Intended outcomes

- Users can complete the primary workflow without undocumented manual intervention.
- Operators can identify ownership, state, and failure cause.
- Reviewers can trace significant decisions to inputs and authorized actors.
- Maintainers can evolve the system through backward-compatible, versioned change.

## Non-goals

This baseline does not authorize production launch, define legal advice, certify compliance, or approve a specific vendor, model, chain, or data source. Those decisions require recorded owners and evidence.

## Measures to approve

Before declaring the vision achieved, set baselines and targets for workflow completion, error rate, accessibility, latency, support burden, security findings, and user trust. Do not publish targets until the measurement method and accountable owner are recorded.
